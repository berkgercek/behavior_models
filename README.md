# behavior models

This is the readme for the behavioral models. We developped a series of models, for the moment there are 3:
- the exponential smoothing model based on the previous actions (called `expSmoothing_prevAction`)
- the exponential smoothing model based on the previous stimulus sides (called `expSmoothing_stimside`)
- the smoothing model with fitted kernel based on the previous stimulus sides (called `smoothing_stimside`)

See the `main.py` file for an example on prior generation
